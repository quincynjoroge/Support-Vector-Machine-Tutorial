# Support Vector Machine Tutorial

NB: This is class work that I have done during my Masters degree at the university of westinster

Implementing Kernel SVM with Scikit-Learn is similar to the simple SVM. In this section, we will use the famous iris dataset to predict the category to which a plant belongs based on four attributes: sepal-width, sepal-length, petal-width and petal-length. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris4 The rest of the steps are typical machine learning steps and need very little explanation until we reach the part where we train our Kernel SVM.
